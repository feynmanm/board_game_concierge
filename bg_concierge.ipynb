No place in space has resource value without a local supply of water, primarily for rocket propellant and \"exofuels\", but also for chemical and mineralogical processing, dust control, crops, and life support. Water is a storable and convenient source of hydrogen, the superior propellant for thermodynamic rockets. Water is a natural shield against energetic protons, kilo for kilo better than regolith or even metals. Finally, without recycling, each man-year requires 10 tonnes of water. (Although it is worth noting that human metabolisms convert carbohydrates plus oxygen into carbon dioxide and water, thus we are stoichiometrically net producers rather than consumers of water.) \n",

            "22 WATER AVAILABILITY is greatest on worlds with icy cores, where simply injecting steam into a wellhole produces water. On drier worlds, where water only occurs as tiny ice crystals or hydrated silicates, the regolith would need to be crushed, sealed in a vessel at 1 atm, and cooked to 700 K to extract water as vapor. The vapor is then liquified by cooling to 280 K and separating solids and gases. The liquid water (some of which is recycled to the first step) is degassed briefly in a vacuum to remove dissolved gasses, and placed in storage. Assuming 4% water content in 70% of the top 2 meters of regolith, four tonnes of regolith must be scavenged to obtain 120 kg/day of water. In one year, one game FT is extracted from an excavated area of about 1100 m2 (about 24 X 24 meters). —Lewis et al., Resources of Near-Earth Space, 1993.\n",

            "44 RAD-HARDNESS is rated on the accumulated dosage of environmental radiation a piece of equipment can survive, as measured in krad (Si). 1 krad (Si) = 10 J/kg of silicon. The chief radiation hazards are high energy protons from CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections) and radiation belts (electrons & gammas are more easily shielded). Both sources of protons increase 1000X after a major solar event. Electronics and photovoltaic cells are particularly affected. Because shielding beyond a centimeter of aluminum has little effect, the rad-hardness of electronics is improved by using circuits that do not readily latch-up or upset, and guarded by error-correcting and watchdog timers. Such circuits include Radiation Hard CMOS and AsGa circuits, with rad-hardness 5 (about a Mrad).\n",

The Russian Proton boosts at $4000/kg, and the Shuttle boosted at $10,000/kg. For half the delta-v (required change in spacecraft velocity), a rocket tanker can haul ISRU water to LEO from the martian moons or NEAs (Near Earth Asteroids). Water is valuable in LEO, which is drier than the Sahara. People get thirsty, but at least human water needs can be recycled. A rocket is far more thirsty than 100 people, and the water it consumes is lost forever. \n",

            "66 ROCKET SCIENCE mainly concerns getting propellant to intercept fuel energy efficiently. This energy is usually radiation and energetic particles from chemical or nuclear reactions. Lines and windows characterize the opacity of a propellant across a radiation spectrum; lines are where the radiation is absorbed and windows are where the radiation gets through. Dirty reactions are those that generate products that are not easily absorbed by water or hydrogen propellant. This deals a double whammy: not only is escaping radiation wasted, but it also creates waste heat that must be rejected by radiators (other than radiation passing directly into space; for instance, half of proton-antiproton energy escapes via neutrinos). Examples of dirty reactions are high neutron fission, D-T fusion, and antimatter reactions. Clean reactions include chemical rockets and aneutronic fusion like 3He-D and H-B.\n",

Some of the larger outer worlds, like Ceres, Ganymede, and Europa, have polar ice caps and may have subterranean oceans. The D-type asteroids, common in the Trojans and other outer reaches, have never been hot enough to chemically bind their water to minerals, and their water may be still be sequestered as primal icy cores. Closer in, solar heat has bound the water of C- and W-types into hydrated silicates and clays. (Hertha and Lutetia are actually W-type, and not M-type as stated on the map.) A few main-belt \"asteroids\" are active comets like 133P/Elst-Pizarro. These must have lost their surface volatiles long ago, but were \"revived\" by recent collisions that exposed buried ices. M-, S-, and V-types are drier, but the larger ones may have primeval water protected by a permafrost layer. The moons of Earth and Mars, while anhydrous on the surface, may have buried ice crystals in the polar regions, or in places impacted by aqueous comets or asteroids. Missions such as the 2009 LCROSS impactor suggest water ice lies in the south lunar pole. One can find ice even on Mercury, in permanent shadows on the north pole.\n",

            "1010 HOHMANN TRANSFER. If a rocket in a circular orbit makes an impulsive thrust in any direction, it flies into an elliptical orbit. By thrusting again at the extreme limit (periapsis or apoapsis) of this ellipse, it can enter a destination orbit either higher (superior) or lower (inferior) than its starting one. This elliptical route, requiring a high thrust at each end and a lot of coasting in-between, is called a Hohmann transfer. The Hohmann is usually the trajectory requiring the lowest delta-v to reach a destination orbit. The routes on the map are modeled on Hohmann ellipses. The Hohmann requires that the destination and embarkation bodies be close to opposition (at opposite sides of Sol). Therefore, the launch windows for a Hohmann can be considerable, varying from 3.5 months for Earth-Mercury, to just under 6 years for Earth-Saturn. The Hohmann transfer is illustrated in the Appendix (W3.Q5). \n",

Even more significant, Lagrange Points are embarkation spots for the Interplanetary Transit Network. Of the five points, L4 and L5 are the only stable ones. \n",
